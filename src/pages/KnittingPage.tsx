            Knitting creates multiple loops of yarn, called stitches, in a line
            or tube. Knitting has multiple active stitches on the needle at one
            time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of
            interlocking loops. As each row progresses, a newly created loop is
            pulled through one or more loops from the prior row, placed on the
            gaining needle, and the loops from the prior row are then pulled off
            the other needle. Different types of yarns (fiber type, texture, and
            twist), needle sizes, and stitch types may be used to achieve
            knitted fabrics with diverse properties (color, texture, weight,
            heat retention, water resistance, and/or integrity). Knitting
            department consists of more than 160 state-of-the-art knitting
            machines in diameter from 20'' to 36'' in gauge from 18GG to 32 GG.
            In addition, flat knitting machines are used to produce collars and
            cuffs. There are open-width knitting machines to knit cotton. All
            yarns used in knitting are Xorella conditioned waxed yarns cleared
            using color and PP contamination clearers. Yarns used in knitting
            are contamination controlled through several stages. Egyyarnâ€™s
            technical team is well versed in maintaining the correct stitch
            length, correct weight per square meter and controlling the
            spirality to the bare minimum. Each roll has a quality sticker
            indicating the total defects and type of defects and is bar-coded.

            Egyyarn is committed to using the latest technologies in spinning.
            Highest technologies are adopted to ensure the quality that we seek.
            For example: The automatic plucking of cotton bales ensures there
            are no curls or damage in the final product and also guarantees that
            the tufts of fiber are as small as possible. The tension control
            during the winding operation controls the fuzziness and hairiness of
            the fiber. The automatic tension control reduces the chances of
            damaged fibers. The suction systems at all production stages keeps
            the machinery system clean and dust free. Systems are integrated to
            give the best performance and the highest quality. The spinning
            solutions, the automatic cone winders, twisting machines, assembly
            winder, the Air conditioning systems are from Germany, Switzerland
            and Italy. We aim at the latest technologies that meet our customer
            requirement for high end quality cotton yarns.
